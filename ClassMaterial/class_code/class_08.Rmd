```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r eval = FALSE}

SDS100::download_data("gapminder_2007.Rda")


```






```{r}

library(SDS100)


# Get the gapminder data

# load("gapminder_2007.Rda")

# lifeExp <- gapminder_2007$lifeExp 


```



$\\$



```{r}


# We can use the sample(data_vec, n) to get a sample of length n:



# How can we get x-bar from this sample in R? 


```



$\\$


Q: How can we get a full sampling distribution?




$\\$




```{r}
# we can repeat a process many times using the SDS100 do_it() function

do_it(100)  *  {
  
  2 + 3

}

```



$\\$


$\\$


```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Let's create a sampling distribution in R





# create a histogram of the sampling distribution


# get the population mean, and the mean of the sampling distribution
# is there bias? 



# add a vertical line to our sampling distribution histogram at mu



```




$\\$


What happens to the sampling distribution as we change n? 
Experiment for n = 1, 5, 10, 20 



$\\$



```{r, eval = FALSE}












```
