## Part 1: Questions examining sampling and bias


The following questions are intended to improve your understanding of sampling, bias, sampling distributions and confidence intervals. I also recommend trying additional questions from the Lock5 textbook to get more practice.



$\\$



**Exercise 1.1** (6 points): In a sample survey of professors at the University of Nebraska, 94% of them described themselves as "above average" teachers. Please answer the following questions: 

a. What is the sample? What is the population?

b. Based on the information provided, can we conclude that the study suffers from sampling bias? 

c. Is 94% a good estimate for the percentage of above-average teachers at the University of Nebraska? If not, why not? 




**Answers**:

a. 

b. 

c. 




$\\$





**Exercise 1.2** (7 points): Employment statistics in the US are often based on two nationwide monthly surveys: the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey. The CPS samples approximately 60,000 US households and collects the employment status, job type, and demographic information of each resident in the household. The CES survey samples 140,000 nonfarm businesses and government agencies and collects the number of payroll jobs, pay rates, and related information for each firm.

a. What is the population in the CPS survey?

b. What is the population in the CES survey?

For each of the following statistical questions, state whether the results from the CPS or CES survey would be more relevant.

  i.	 Do larger companies tend to have higher salaries?

  ii.	 What percentage of Americans are self-employed?

  iii. Are married men more or less likely to be employed than single men?




**Answers**:


a. 

b. 


  i. 

  ii.

  iii.

## Part 2: Questions examining sampling distributions and confidence intervals



**Exercise 2.1** (8 points): A household consists of all people occupying a housing unit as their primary place of residence. The latest US Census lists the average household size in the United States as 2.61 people. Figure 1 shows possible distributions of means for 1000 samples of household sizes. The scale on the horizontal axis is the same in all four cases. 

a. Assume that two of the distributions show results from 1000 random samples, while two others show distributions from a sampling method that is biased. Which two dotplots appear to show samples produced using a biased sampling method? Explain your reasoning. Pick one of the distributions that you listed as biased and describe a sampling method that might produce this bias. 

b. For the two distributions that appear to show results from random samples, suppose that one comes from 1000 samples of size n = 100 and one comes from 1000 samples of size n = 500. Which distribution goes with which sample size? Explain.

**Exercise 2.2** (8 points): In preparing for a test on a set of topics, is it better to study one topic at a time or to study topics mixed together? In one study, a sample of fourth graders were taught four equations. Half of the children learned by studying repeated examples of one equation at a time, while the other half studied mixed problem sets that included examples of all four types of calculations grouped together. A day later, all the students were given a test on the material. The students in the mixed practice group had an average grade of 77, while the students in the one-at-a-time group had an average grade of 38. 

Please answer the following questions about the study:

a. Give notation (i.e,. two symbols separated by a minus sign) for the quantity we are trying to estimate using the symbols we have discussed in class. 

b. Give notation (i.e,. two symbols separated by a minus sign) for the quantity that gives the best estimate from our data using the symbols we have discussed in class.

c. Give the value of the best estimate of the quantity we are trying to estimate.


For parts a and b, sure to clearly define what all symbols mean in the context of what the research study was examining.



**Answers**:  


a. 




b.





c.

**Exercise 2.3** (12 points): The data set CollegeScores4yr contains information on over 2,000 4-year US colleges and universities. One of the variables in this data set is the in-state tuition cost which is the price that students who live in the state pay to attend the college/university. Figure 2 shows two box plots. One represents the in-state tuition cost data for one random sample of n = 30 individual colleges/universities. The other represents a sampling distribution of 1,000 means of in-state tuition cost data for samples of size 30. 

a. Which is which? Explain.

b. From the box plot showing the data from one random sample, what does one value in the sample represent? How many values are included in the data to make the box plot? Estimate the minimum and maximum values. Give a rough estimate of the mean of the values and use appropriate notation for your answer. 

c. From the box plot showing the data from a sampling distribution, what does one value in the sampling distribution represent? How many values are included in the data to make the box plot? Estimate the minimum and maximum values. Give a rough estimate of the value of the population parameter and use appropriate notation for your answer.

**Exercise 2.4** (10 points): A report from a Gallup poll in 2001 started by saying "Forty-five percent of American adults reported getting their health insurance from an employer..." Later in the article we find information on the sampling method, "a random sample of 147,291 adults, aged 18 and over, living in the US," and a sentence about the accuracy of the results, "the maximum margin of sampling error is $\pm$ 1 percentage point".


a. What is the population? What is the sample? What is the population parameter of interest? What is the relevant statistic? 

b. Use the margin of error to give an interval estimate for the parameter of interest. Interpret this interval in the context of the problem. 





**Answers**:


a. 



b.

**Exercise 2.5** (10 points): Overeating for just four weeks can increase fat mass and weight over two years later, a Swedish study shows. Researchers recruited 18 healthy and normal-weight people with an average age of 26. For a four-week period, participants increased calorie intake by 70% (mostly by eating fast food) and limited daily activity to a maximum of 5000 steps per day (considered sedentary). Not surprisingly, width and body fat of the participants went up significantly during the study and then decreased after the study ended. Participants are believed to have returned to the diet and lifestyle they had before the experiment. However, two and a half years after the experiment, the mean weight gain for participants was 6.8 lbs with a standard error of 1.2 lbs. A control group that did not binge had no change in weight. 

a. What is the relevant parameter? 

b. How could we find the actual exact value of the parameter? 

c. Give a 95% confidence interval for the parameter and interpret it.

d. Give the margin of error and interpret it. 




**Answers**:


a.  


b.


c. 


d.

## Part 3: Practice examining sampling distributions and calucating standard errors in R



In homework 0, exercise 2.3-2.5 you used the function `get_sprinkle_sample(n)` to get a (virtual) sample of sprinkle colors and then you calculated the proportion of red sprinkles in the sample. You then repeated this process for different sample sizes of n. In the exercises below we will now create a sampling distribution for the proportion of red sprinkles.



**Exercise 3.1** (7 points):  For the first exercise, let's just review calculating the proportion of red sprinkles. Use the `get_sprinkle_sample()` function to get a sample of size n = 100 and calculate the proportion of red sprinkles. Report this statistic using the proper symbol. Note: the `table()` and the `prop.table()` functions might be useful here.


```{r q3_1}

# do not change these lines of code
library(SDS100)
set.seed(100)







```



**Answer**: 






$\\$






    
    
    
**Exercise 3.2** (7 points): Now use the `do_it()` function to create a sampling distribution of the proportion of red sprinkles. Each statistic in the sampling distribution should be based on a sample size of n = 100, and there should be 10,000 sample statistics in the sampling distribution. Then create a histogram of the sampling distribution and report the standard error and what the shape of the sampling distribution looks like. 


```{r q3_2}














```


**Answer**: 






$\\$









**Exercise 3.3** (8 points): Now repeat exercise 3.2 for sample sizes of n = 25 and n = 400.  How does the standard error change as function of the sample size n? Does this make sense to you? 

```{r q3_3}
























```



**Answers**:








$\\$








**Exercise 3.4** (11 points):  Finally, draw one additional single sample of size n = 100 and calculate the 95% confidence interval based on this sample and the standard error calculated in exercise 3.2. Then repeat this process for n = 25, and n = 400 using the standard errors calculated in exercise 3.3. Report all these 95% confidence intervals and whether they change as you expected. Also, what do you think the value of the parameter is, and do you think any of these confidence intervals do not contain this parameter? 


```{r q3_4}


  








  

```



**Answer**: The proportion of red sprinkles is ...


a. The confidence interval for n = 100 is:  

b. The confidence interval for n = 25 is:  

c. The confidence interval for n = 400 is: 


My best guess at the parameter is...
